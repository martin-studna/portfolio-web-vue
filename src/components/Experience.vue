                As a Machine Learning Engineer at ATOL Capital, I was responsible for the implementation and design of ML models for predicting crypto currency prices and other statistics. I utilized the Black Scholes Model to analyze historical and implied volatility, providing insight into the direction of the crypto market. I worked closely with the team to develop and implement these models, leveraging my expertise in machine learning techniques and statistical analysis to drive business decisions and achieve key objectives.

                    I develop Computer Vision software that can primarily segment neuron cells from fluorescence microscopy images of mice brain. The other objective is to qualitatively measure neuron cells intensity to determine the activity of neurons. The motivation behind the research lies in observing cognitive functions when stimulating a mouse with a drug.

                    In my role as a Software Engineer at IBM, I was responsible for designing and implementing chatbot solutions for clients using my skills in Vue.js for the frontend and node.js for integration with IBM Watson API. I had the opportunity to work on projects such as the Vodafone Tobi chatbot and Ane≈æka, a virtual assistant providing relevant information about covid-19 and the state of emergency in Czechia. These projects allowed me to gain valuable experience in chatbot development and solidify my skills in Vue.js and node.js.
